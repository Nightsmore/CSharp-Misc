# Bogo Sort

This is a demonstration of Bogo Sort written in C#. Bogo Sort, also known as Stupid Sort, Slow Sort, and several other synonomous names, is a sorting method which takes a data set, shuffles it, and checks if it's sorted. If not, repeat. 

There are 2 versions of Bogo Sort, one which randomizes it's input until it sorts, that's the one that I have written here. 
The other version is 'deterministic'. This version goes through each possible assortment until sorted.
